- Hi, I’m @rattus-aristarchus
- I’m a technical author in IT, I write mostly about QA. I've also worked as a translator (again, mostly in IT), and I have a degree in history, with a particular interest in history of technology.
- I love writing code when I'm able to write it well, and putting that understanding into text.
- Codewise, the main project I'm working on is scholastica, an app for organizing notes.
- You can reach me via lankin.m.a@gmail.com
