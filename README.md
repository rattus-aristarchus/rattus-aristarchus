- Hi, I’m @rattus-aristarchus
- I’m a freelance english-russian translator, mostly working with texts related to IT. I love writing code when I'm able to write it well, and I believe that doing it allows me to better understand what I'm translating.
- The main project I'm working on is scholastica, an app for organizing notes.
- You can reach me via lankin.m.a@gmail.com
