- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rattus-aristarchus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a freelance english-russian translator, mostly working with texts related to IT. I love writing code when I'm able to write it well, and I believe that doing it allows me to better understand what I'm translating.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, and collaborating with a good friend of mine on a piece of software for a tabletop rpg we're developing together.
