Hi, I’m Mikhail Lankin.

I’m a technical author and I write mostly about QA. I've also worked as a translator (again, mostly in IT), and I have a degree in history, with a particular interest in history of technology. Some of the stuff I've done lately:

- An article about [legacy code](https://dzone.com/articles/legacy-code)
- A [demo test base for the arXiv website](https://github.com/rattus-aristarchus/test_arxiv)
- A [Russian translation of a 1980s article on the Sagas pattern](https://habr.com/ru/users/mikhail-lankin/publications/articles/) 

I've studied history of technology and economics at the Saint-Petersburg State University, Moscow State University, and the European University in Saint Petersburg. My main area of interest has been technological development of Soviet-type economies.
